### IDEA <br>
This app tends to work on an idea that anyone who is stuck in any natural calamity like earthquake or floods may easily get help through 
NDRF team and emergency contacts . App gets your location and sends it to the concerned so that help can be provided to you <hr>
### WORKING <br>
The app uses the GPS location and all the data like my emergency contact list and a parameter to decide whether there is any disaster or not in my current realtime database.<br>
The disaster parameter is changed realtime not by the user but by the realtime earthquake APIs to know if the phone's location lies in the earthquake region or not. The app sends the alert to all my emergency contacts at once if disaster parameter changes<hr>
### CONCLUSION <br>
The app is best suited for the regions where there are chances for natural disasters in spotting and rescuing them using their phone's location
